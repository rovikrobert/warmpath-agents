# WarmPath Agentic Engineering Team

## Overview

The `agents/` directory contains an automated engineering team that scans the WarmPath codebase for issues across five domains: code architecture, test quality, performance, dependencies, and documentation. A lead agent aggregates findings into prioritized daily briefs.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all agents and generate daily brief
python -m agents.orchestrator --all

# Run a single agent
python -m agents.orchestrator --agent architect

# Generate brief from cached reports (no scanning)
python -m agents.orchestrator --lead-only

# Weekly trend report
python -m agents.orchestrator --weekly

# Refresh external intelligence (pip-audit, dep versions)
python -m agents.orchestrator --intel-update

# Skip test_engineer for faster runs (it runs pytest)
python -m agents.orchestrator --all --skip-tests

# Verbose logging
python -m agents.orchestrator --all -v
```

## Agents

| Agent | Scans For | Key Checks |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **architect** | Code quality & structure | ruff lint/format, file sizes, function lengths, conventions, N+1 queries, hardcoded secrets |
| **test_engineer** | Test coverage & quality | pytest --cov, assertion density, error-path coverage, coverage trends |
| **perf_monitor** | Performance & costs | Claude API token costs, missing DB indexes, N+1 patterns, unbounded queries, table growth projections |
| **deps_manager** | Dependency health | Version pinning, CVEs (pip-audit), dead/missing deps, licenses, Dockerfile |
| **doc_keeper** | Documentation accuracy | CLAUDE.md sync (test/table counts), API docstrings, privacy policy claims, conventions |
| **lead** | Aggregation & prioritization | Deduplicates cross-agent findings, generates daily briefs, tracks trends |

## Self-Learning System

Each agent maintains a `state.json` with:
- **Finding history** (last 500 entries) — tracks recurrence of issues
- **Attention weights** — files with more findings get higher scrutiny
- **Metrics history** (last 90 entries) — enables trend analysis (up/down/stable)
- **Resolution tracking** — records how findings are resolved (fixed/deferred/ignored)

The lead agent uses these to:
- Escalate chronic issues (seen 3+ times)
- Detect regressions (metric trending in wrong direction)
- Recommend strategic actions based on patterns

## Severity Levels

| Level | Weight | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| critical | 10 | Act immediately — security breach, data loss risk |
| high | 5 | Fix soon — CVEs, N+1 queries, privacy violations |
| medium | 2 | Plan to fix — large files, missing coverage, doc drift |
| low | 1 | Nice to have — formatting, missing docstrings |
| info | 0 | Informational only |

## Configuration

Key thresholds in `agents/shared/config.py`:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `COVERAGE_WARN_THRESHOLD` | 80% | Flag modules below this coverage |
| `COVERAGE_CRITICAL_MODULES` | 90% | Stricter threshold for security/finance modules |
| `FILE_SIZE_WARN_LINES` | 300 | Flag files larger than this |
| `FUNCTION_SIZE_WARN_LINES` | 30 | Flag functions longer than this |
| `TEST_SLOW_THRESHOLD_SECONDS` | 2.0 | Flag slow tests |
| `QUERIES_PER_REQUEST_WARN` | 5 | Potential N+1 threshold |
| `DEP_STALE_DAYS` | 365 | Flag deps not updated in this long |
| `MAX_FINDINGS_PER_BRIEF` | 10 | Cap low-priority items in brief |
| `INTEL_CACHE_TTL_HOURS` | 24 | Intelligence cache lifetime |

## Output Format

### Daily Brief (generated by lead agent)

```
## Engineering Brief — 2026-02-17

### Critical (act now)
{0-2 items max}

### Attention Needed
{3-5 prioritized items}

### Healthy
{What's going well}

### Metrics
- Tech debt score: {N} ({trend})
- Test coverage: {%}
- Open findings: {count by severity}

### Recommendations
{1-2 strategic suggestions}
```

### Individual Agent Reports

Each agent produces an `AgentReport` containing:
- Timestamped findings with severity, file location, and recommendations
- Metrics (coverage %, finding counts, costs, etc.)
- Intelligence notes (what external data informed the scan)
- Learning updates (attention weight changes, trend observations)
